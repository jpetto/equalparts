My first experience with "programming" was hacking curse words into the slogan
file of
[Scorched Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scorched_Earth_%28video_game%29)
on my [386](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_80386). It's just text files.

I went to college for I don't know what and signed up for an HTML class to have
enough credits to qualify for financial aid. I was hooked as soon as I realized
I could make art by typing - abstract, minimal, terrible poetry with letters and
words set in different styles. I used the `<font>` tag and FTP uphill both ways
in the snow.

[Taylor](https://web.archive.org/web/20000622091351/http://hotwired.lycos.com/webmonkey/html/96/49/index2a.html?tw=programming),
and a great instructor named [Ben Chang](http://www.bcchang.com/) taught me
JavaScript. During my last year of college, I transitioned from (dial-up!) tech
support to my company's consulting firm, programming in classic ASP, followed by
ColdFusion, and finally .NET. Sharepoint turned out to be my limit, so I moved
on to the LAMP stack and open source. In 2009, I quit my office job and went out
on my own, building things in WordPress, Rails, PHP, C#, and of course
JavaScript.

Later in 2009, in desperate need of physicality, noise, and mess (read: *not*
coding), without a lick of experience, I
[somehow managed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_privilege) to land a
part-time [barista](/images/random/intelli.png) job at
[Intelligentsia](http://www.intelligentsiacoffee.com/). Improbably, it was
learning how to make coffee that led me to the best company I'd ever worked for
 &mdash; [Mozilla](https://www.mozilla.org). Life never happens how you think it will.
